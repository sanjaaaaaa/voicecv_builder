# üó£Ô∏è Your Voice, Your CV, Instantly.

VoiceCV Builder is an innovative web application developed for the Bhashini Startup Velocity 2.0 Hackathon. It aims to revolutionize resume creation by making it voice-driven and highly accessible.

# ‚ú® Features

* Voice Input: Easily dictate your resume content using your voice.
* Multilingual Support: Speak in various Indian languages (and English) to populate your CV.
* Real-time Editor: See instant updates as you add or modify content.
* Structured Sections: Organize your resume with dedicated sections for personal info, experience, education, skills, projects, and awards.
* PDF Export: Download your professionally formatted CV as a clean PDF document.

# üöÄ Get Started (Run Locally)

To run VoiceCV Builder on your machine:

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone [https://github.com/sanjaaaaaa/voicecv_builder.git](https://github.com/sanjaaaaaa/voicecv_builder.git)
    cd voicecv_builder

2.  Install dependencies:
    npm install

3.  Configure Bhashini Translation (Optional, but recommended for multilingual input):
    * Open `src/context/VoiceContext.jsx`.
    * Find `BHASHINI_TRANSLATION_ENDPOINT`, `INFERENCE_API_KEY`, and `UDYAT_KEY`.
    * Replace the placeholder values (`"YOUR_..."`) with your actual Bhashini API endpoint and keys obtained from the Bhashini team.
    * (Note: Voice input (ASR) uses your browser's native capabilities, but translation from Indian languages to English requires Bhashini's Translation API.)

4.  Start the application:
    npm run dev

5.  Open in browser:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
